URL Shortener
Allow users to create short versions of links to make them easier to speak and share.
For example, https://some.place.example.com/foo/bar/biz being shorted to
https://short.ly/abc123

Having a short URL can be nice for making it easier for people to type it in, whether hearing it
on a podcast or reading it on a poster. Sure, QR codes sort of stole the show for the latter use
case, but it's still a good learning project!

Requirements
- Save a record of the shortened URL to a database
- Ensure the slug of the URL (abc123 in the screenshot above) is unique
- When the shortened URL is accessed, redirect to the stored URL -
If an invalid slug is accessed, display a 404 Not Found page

Extra Credit
- Add support for accounts so people can view the URLs they created -
Validate the URL provided is an actual URL
- Display an error message if invalid
- Make it easy to copy the shortened URL to the clipboard -
Allow users to modify the slug of their URL
- Track visits to the shortened URL
- Add rate-limiting to prevent bad-actors from spamming the service -
Update API to follow a known spec (such as json:api)
